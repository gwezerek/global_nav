Politicians can easily claim pro-life credentials not by taking definable stances on the issue of abortion itself, but merely by opposing a line item in the federal budget. That’s why, following poll numbers, we go from the hazy language of “moral clarity” and “remembering” to denouncing a single (though admittedly large and powerful) nonprofit organization. What about the legality of abortion? What about Roe v. Wade? No need to get that specific."

Best to shift the question to the kind of judicial appointments you’ll make. The idea is to signal ideological and cultural kinship, not necessarily to announce policy proposals."
